Perfect — that’s a smart approach. Let’s outline the **complete topic coverage** before building the actual quiz.

Here’s a **comprehensive topic checklist** that matches your study guide (and the items you said you must know word-for-word).
Once you confirm this list, I’ll build a **long-form short-answer quiz** that includes:

* Definition recall (for the word-for-word ones)
* Concept/application questions (for understanding)
* Scenario-based questions (for synthesis and reasoning)
