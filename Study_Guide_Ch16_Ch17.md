# Study Guide — Chapters 16 & 17  
Supply Chain Management & Sourcing

## 🔑 Key Terms (max 10)
1. **Supply Chain** – Network of suppliers, manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, and retailers that adds value through material and information flows.
2. **Distribution Channel** – Downstream path from producer to customers; only part of a total supply chain.
3. **Throughput Time** – Total cycle time across all entities in a supply chain.
4. **Cash-to-Cash Cycle Time** – Days in inventory + days in A/R − days in A/P.
5. **Total Delivered Cost** – Sum of all costs added across the supply chain.
6. **Bullwhip Effect** – Increasing variability of orders upstream.
7. **Modular Product Design** – Product built from interchangeable modules.
8. **Postponement** – Delaying final product differentiation until later stages.
9. **Supply Chain Resilience** – Ability to detect, respond, and recover from disruptions.
10. **Outsourcing / Offshoring / Reshoring** – Key sourcing strategies.

# 📘 Chapter 16 — Supply Chain Management

## 16.1 What is SCM?
A supply chain includes all value-adding processes across suppliers, manufacturers, logistics, distributors, and retailers. Integrated information flow is essential.

---

## 16.2 Key Metrics (Guiding Q1)

### **1. Throughput Time**
Sum of cycle times across supplier → manufacturer → wholesaler → retailer.

### **2. Cash-to-Cash Cycle Time**
Formula:  
`Days Inventory + Days A/R − Days A/P`

### **3. Total Delivered Cost**
Sum of:
- Supplier cost
- Manufacturing cost
- Logistics cost
- Wholesaler cost
- Retailer cost

---

## 16.3 Bullwhip Effect (Guiding Q2)
Bullwhip = inflated demand variability upstream.  
Caused by: safe harbor ordering, inventory panic, poor forecasting, long lead times.

**How to reduce:**  
- Share real demand  
- Reduce lead times  
- Everyday low pricing  
- Lean practices  

---

## 16.5 Improving Supply Chain Structure (Guiding Q3, Q4)
Ways to improve structure:
1. Forward/backward integration  
2. Major process simplification  
3. Reconfiguring suppliers/wareasures  
4. Product redesign  

**Modular Design + Postponement:**  
Modules allow final customization at later stages → lower inventory and higher flexibility.

---

## 16.6 Improving Operations Within Same Structure (Guiding Q5)
Three key improvements:
1. Cross-functional teams  
2. Lean systems  
3. Information systems  

---

## 16.7 Information Systems, Amazon Effect, Blockchain (Guiding Q6–8)

### **Order systems improve:**
- Forecasting
- Inventory visibility
- Direct production/procurement triggers
- Analytics for better decisions

### **Amazon Effect & Omni-Channel**
- Faster delivery expectations  
- Seamless customer experience across store, web, mobile, catalogs, social media

### **Blockchain**
Secure, shared ledger improving transparency and reducing disputes.

---

## 16.8 Supply Chain Resilience (Guiding Q9)
Three phases:
1. Proactive (planning, alternate suppliers, buffers)  
2. Reactive (damage control)  
3. Recovery (restoration & learning)  

Pandemic lesson:  
Over-lean, single-source supply chains had major failures.

---

## 16.9 Sustainability & Triple Bottom Line (Guiding Q10)
Three P’s: **People, Planet, Profit**  
Goal example: reduce carbon emissions by 20% in 5 years.

---

# 📘 Chapter 17 — Sourcing

## 17.2 Typical Goals (Guiding Q1)
- Access technology/innovation  
- Reduce total costs  
- Reduce quality/delivery risk  
- Ensure ethical & socially responsible sourcing  

---

## 17.3 Outsourcing Pros/Cons (Guiding Q2)

**Advantages:**  
- Access to tech  
- Scale economies  
- Lower total cost  

**Disadvantages:**  
- Disruption risk  
- Quality failures  
- IP loss  
- Supplier dependence  

---

## 17.4 Cost Calculations & Offshoring (Guiding Q3)

**Compare:**  
`In-house cost = DL + Materials + OH`  
`Offshore cost = Price + Shipping + Tariffs + Monitoring + Admin + Risk`

Additional offshoring costs: currency risk, quality failures, IP loss, longer lead times.

---

## 17.5 Global Sourcing, Single vs Multiple Suppliers, Reshoring (Guiding Q4)

### **Global Sourcing Advantages**
- Lower cost labor/materials  
- Access to skills  
- New market access  

### **Disadvantages**
- Longer lead times  
- Political risk  
- Monitoring cost  

### **Single vs Multiple Sourcing**
- Single: partnership, scale, but high risk  
- Multiple: lower risk, flexibility  

### **Reshoring**
Driven by:
- Rising offshore wages  
- Supply chain risk  
- Tariff risk  
- Need for shorter lead times

# 📐 Solved Examples

## **Example 1 — Supply Chain Metrics**

### a. Total Throughput Time
`20 + 60 + 30 + 20 = 130 days`

### b. Cash-to-Cash Times
Supplier: `20 + 30 − 45 = 5`  
Factory: `60 + 45 − 30 = 75`  
Wholesaler: `30 + 30 − 60 = 0`  
Retailer: `20 + 40 − 47 = 13`  

### c. Total Delivered Cost and Profit
Costs added: `$10 + 5 + 50 + 15 + 40 = $120`  
Profit: `$3 + 14 + 104 + 14 = $41`

---

## **Example 2 — Sourcing (Ch.17 #3)**

Supplier A: $6.20 but low quality  
Supplier B: $6.80, better quality  
Supplier C: $7.20, best quality  

**Answer:**  
Choose Supplier **B or C**.  
A is rejected because low price ≠ total value.

---

## **Example 3 — Offshoring Cost Calculation (Ch.17 #5)**

U.S. cost:  
DL 55 + Materials 122 + OH 47 = **224**

China costs:  
DL = 33  
Materials = 109.8  
OH = 28.2  
Production total = **171**

Shipping = $54  
Monitoring/Admin = $34  

**Total China landed cost = 171 + 54 + 34 = 259**  
U.S. = 224 → **China is more expensive**

**Risks:** quality issues, IP loss, lead time, currency volatility  
**Conclusion:** Don’t outsource.
